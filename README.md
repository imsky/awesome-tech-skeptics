## Single page applications

**[SPAs were a mistake](https://gomakethings.com/spas-were-a-mistake/)** (2022) by [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com)<br>

**[Second-guessing the modern web](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html)** (2020) by [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com)
  > We’re layering optimizations upon optimizations in order to get the SPA-like pattern to fit every use case, and I’m not sure that it is, well, worth it.

**[You probably don't need a single-page application](https://plausible.io/blog/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app)** (2019) by [Uku Taht](https://twitter.com/ukutaht)

  > The Preact stuff is kind of fun. But it feels like adding a lot of complexity, and I can’t pin down how it benefits most of these projects.

**[Single Page Application is not a Silver Bullet](https://blog.bloomca.me/2018/02/04/spa-is-not-silver-bullet.html)** (2018) by [Seva Zaikov](https://blog.bloomca.me/)

  > I have heard many statements from SPA advocates, that turned out to be false promises in reality. Ideas, that sound great in theory, but somehow never work in practice.

**[Why I hate your Single Page App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-hate-your-single-page-app-f08bb4ff9134)** (2016) by Stefan Tilkov
